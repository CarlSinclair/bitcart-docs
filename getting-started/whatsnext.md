## Creating the Point of Sale Store <a href="#creating-the-point-of-sale-app" id="creating-the-point-of-sale-app"></a>

BitcartCC has a ready store which you can use to receive payments from your customers directly or to receive donations. To start using it, you will need to have a store created in BitcartCC. View PoS instructions [here](../guides/store-pos.md).

## Creating Custom Invoices <a href="#creating-the-payment-request" id="creating-the-payment-request"></a>

Create custom invoices which can be shared with others, by sending a link to your invoice checkout page. Users can pay the invoice at any time until the invoice has expired.
