## What is underpaid percentage?

Underpaid percentage is a store checkout setting, which can be in range from 0 to 99, indicating that the payment may be that percent less than expected, and it will still be accepted as paid. For example, if customer sends from an exchange wallet and the fees are deducted from the sent amount, the payment will still be accepted if you set underpaid percentage to a small non-zero value.
