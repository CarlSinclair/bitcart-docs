## What is an xpub?

An xpub is a key, which can provide a read-only access to your wallet. It can only be used to watch transactions in your wallet, but not to send them on your behalf. In general, using xpub in some software is safer than using your seed or xprv, but it can leak your privacy if you share your xpub publicly \(watching your wallet\).
