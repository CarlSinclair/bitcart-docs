# Support

This project is open source, and is not a company. Instead we rely on a network of contributors and users to provide support.

## Free support

Problem? Don't worry, someone else has probably been through that before you.

* First have a look at our [user documentation](https://docs.bitcartcc.com) and Frequently Asked Questions.
* If your issue is not referenced there, or you want to request a new feature, please open a [github issue](https://github.com/bitcartcc/bitcart/issues).
* If you have more general questions about BitcartCC, the way it works and why you should use it, you're welcome on our [Telegram](https://t.me/bitcartcc)

Getting a proper support also depends on how you formulate your questions. Read our troubleshooting guidelines.
